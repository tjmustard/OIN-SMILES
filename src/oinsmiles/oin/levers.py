"""One place where every v0.4.5 encoder lever's default lives.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
By the end of v0.4.5 the encoder had nine ``OIN_*`` levers read from ``os.environ`` at nine
scattered call sites, each spelling its own default. Two spellings were already in use across
the codebase and they behave differently:

    os.environ.get("OIN_EMIT_AXIAL")                  # truthy -> "0" ENABLES it
    os.environ.get("OIN_EARLY_EXIT", "1") != "0"      # "0" disables, anything else enables

The first form is a trap: ``OIN_EMIT_AXIAL=0`` turns the lever **on**, because ``"0"`` is a
non-empty string. Anyone opting out the obvious way gets the opposite of what they asked for.

Promoting six levers to default-ON meant touching nine sites and getting the sense right at
every one. Centralizing it makes a promotion a one-line change to ``_DEFAULT_ON`` and makes
the shipped configuration readable in a single place — which matters because "which levers
are on?" is the first question anyone debugging a string difference will ask.

SEMANTICS
=========
``"0"``, ``"false"``, ``"no"``, ``"off"`` and the empty string disable; anything else enables.
So ``OIN_EMIT_AXIAL=0`` now does what it looks like. Callers may also pass an explicit
override (typically from ``ff_params``) which wins over the environment, using a **membership**
test at the call site so an explicit ``False`` can opt out — the pattern
``metallogen_adapter.py``'s ``OIN_EARLY_EXIT`` promotion established in v0.4.4.
